            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>My name is Renato, I'm an international student in algonquin college, I`ve worked as a <sup>videographer</sup> for a few years and now looking to expand my set of skill. For this year I want to <em>learn HTML, CSS and Java for web development</em>, I also want to improve my skills with illustrator and photoshop. </p>
            <p>My hobbies includes flying <abbr>FPV</abbr> drones around the city, playing games like Dota 2, Overwatch and world of warcraft, and also playing tabletop games with friends. I've been to the Algonquin tabletop club a few times, which is a great to way to meet new people here in Ottawa.</p>
